## Emergency Department Triage Data ⚕️

The ED (emergency department) is a hospital or primary health care service that provides initial treatment to patients with a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, some of which may be life-threatening and require immediate attention. EDs provide rapid assessment and management of critical illnesses. After initial assessment and treatment, patients are either admitted to the hospital, stabilised and transferred to another hospital for various reasons, or discharged (Australasian College of Emergency Medicine).Upon arrival in the ED, people usually undergo a brief triage, or interview, to help determine the nature and severity of their illness. Individuals with serious illnesses are then seen by a physician more rapidly than those with less severe symptoms or injuries. The data includes patient attendances, admissions and admissions by Triage for 1 June 2013 to 30 June 2014.
